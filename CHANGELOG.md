## v1.6.0 – Rebrand & Bilingual UI (2025-12-19)

### Feature 1: New Name & Plugin ID
- **Summary**: Rebranded to **Hover Annotations** with a new plugin ID (`hover-annotations`).
- **Problem Solved**: Old name/ID no longer reflected the product focus and caused prefix mismatches.
- **Feature Details**: Manifest, package name, and README now use the new brand; command prefixes align with the new ID.
- **Technical Implementation**: Updated `manifest.json`, package metadata, and code references that derive command IDs from the manifest.

### Feature 2: Bilingual Interface & Commands
- **Summary**: Added full English/Simplified Chinese localization with a language toggle in settings.
- **Problem Solved**: English users previously saw untranslated Chinese strings in commands, notices, and menus.
- **Feature Details**: Settings, notices, tooltips, context menus, and command labels switch instantly when changing language; defaults to English.
- **Technical Implementation**: Centralized `STRINGS` map, stored `language` setting, and dynamic command name updates.

### Feature 3: Annotation Modal UX Polish
- **Summary**: Refined the add/edit modal for clarity and keyboard use.
- **Problem Solved**: Keyboard shortcuts and color selection hints were hidden; action buttons were detached from the color chooser.
- **Feature Details**: Added header with key hints, inline layout for color picker + buttons, clearer active state and labels.
- **Technical Implementation**: New modal structure with flex rows and supporting CSS (`annotation-header-row`, `annotation-color-row`, inline button container).

## v1.5.0 – New Settings Panel & Customization (2025-12-11)

### Feature 1: Comprehensive Appearance Settings
- **Summary**: Introduced a full settings tab for deep customization.
- **Problem Solved**: Fixed styles didn't fit all themes or user preferences.
- **Feature Details**: Toggle underline, background, icon; Adjust opacity for light/dark modes.
- **Technical Implementation**: Added `AnnotationSettingTab` and dynamic CSS variables.

### Feature 2: Minimalist Icon Mode
- **Summary**: Option to show only an icon (📌) without text highlighting.
- **Problem Solved**: Heavy highlighting can distract from reading flow.
- **Feature Details**: Text appears normal; hover/click the end icon to see annotations. Configurable trigger (hover/click).
- **Technical Implementation**: CSS pseudo-elements and precise coordinate detection (`isEventOnIcon`) for mouse events.

### Feature 3: Tooltip Readability Improvements
- **Summary**: Custom width and font scale for annotation tooltips.
- **Problem Solved**: Tooltips were too narrow or small for long notes.
- **Feature Details**: New sliders/inputs for tooltip max-width and font scaling.
- **Technical Implementation**: Mapped settings to CSS variables `--ob-annotation-tooltip-width` etc.

### Feature 4: Data Tools (Export & Fix)
- **Summary**: Utilities to export annotations and fix legacy data.
- **Problem Solved**: Hard to extract notes; legacy format issues.
- **Feature Details**: "Export to Clipboard" and "Fix Data" buttons in settings.

- **Feature Details**: Scans the vault and prompts for confirmation with a file count before execution (simplified UI).

### Feature 2: Markdown & Table Rendering in Tooltips
- **Summary**: Tooltips now render full Markdown syntax, including **tables**.
- **Problem Solved**: Annotations containing tables or complex formatting were previously unreadable.
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Switched to `MarkdownRenderer.render` with proper entity decoding.
  - Added specific CSS for tables inside tooltips (borders, padding, background colors) to ensure readability.
  - **[New] Nested Table Support**: Fixed rendering failure when adding annotations containing tables *inside* another table (via `|` pipe escaping).

### Feature 3: UI & UX Refinements
- **Theme Adaptive Colors**: Optimized highlight contrast for Dark and Light themes.
- **Visuals**: Enlarged context menu icons (48x48) and centered them vertically.
- **Layout**: Refined tooltip padding (`8px 10px`) and spacing.

- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed an issue where the annotation modal input field was missing.

## v1.3.0 – Color Revolution & UX Renewal (Dec 10, 2025)

### Feature 1: New Color System & Visual Interaction
- **Summary**: Expanded annotation colors to 8, introduced a new visual color picker and colorful icons in the right-click menu.
- **Problem Solved**: The old dropdown menu was cumbersome and lacked visual feedback.
- **Feature Details**:
  - New Colors: Red, Orange (Default), Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Gray.
  - Modal: Replaced dropdown with circular color swatches, supporting keyboard navigation (Tab/Enter) and remembering the last used color.
  - Context Menu: Submenu displays real colored dot icons for intuitive preview.
  - New Commands: Independent commands registered for each color (e.g., "Add Annotation (Red)") for easy hotkey binding.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `main.ts`: Implemented dynamic SVG registration via `addIcon`.
  - `styles.css`: Rewrote `.annotation-color-item` styles for hover/active/focus states.

### Feature 2: Native UI & Mobile Support
- **Summary**: Overhauled the tooltip and modal styles to seamlessly blend with Obsidian's native look, added mobile support.
- **Problem Solved**: The old black tooltip looked out of place; modal width was restrictive; no mobile support.
- **Feature Details**:
  - Tooltip: Uses native CSS variables (`--background-secondary`, etc.) for theme adaptability; added slide-up animation; widened to 800px; increased font size.
  - Modal: Inputs use native Obsidian form styles with larger font.
  - Mobile: Supports clicking annotations to show tooltips.
  - Toggle Switch: New command "Toggle Annotation Visibility" to switch clean reading mode on/off.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `styles.css`: Extensive use of `var(--...)` replacing hardcoded colors; added `transition` animations.
  - `main.ts`: Added `click` event listeners; implemented `toggle-annotation-visibility`.

### Feature 3: Context Menu Refactoring
- **Summary**: Optimized the structure, order, and visual feedback of the right-click menu.
- **Problem Solved**: Menu items lacked hierarchy and were scattered.
- **Feature Details**:
  - Order adjusted to: Add -> Edit -> Change Color -> Delete.
  - All items now have icons (highlighter, pencil, palette, trash).
  - Used separators to distinguish plugin functions from other menu items.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - `main.ts`: Used `menu.addSeparator()` and `setIcon`.

### Fixes & Optimizations
- **Default Color Fix**: Corrected the default color issue where it appeared as Red instead of Orange.
- **Build Sync**: Fixed the issue where the build artifact contained oversized icons (100x100 -> 16x16).
- **Undo Experience**: Optimized the `normalizeCurrentFileAnnotations` command to preserve the user's Undo History.
- **Dependency Safety**: Corrected the registry source in the lockfile to ensure compatible dependency installation.

## v1.2.0 — Multi-line Annotations & UX Refinements (2025-12-09)

### Feature 1: Multi-line annotations with safe storage
- **Summary**: Support cross-line annotations with safe encode/decode of note content.
- **Problem Solved**: Previously multi-line annotations failed to render/operate, and special characters could break the HTML attribute.
- **Feature Details**: Multi-line selections stay recognizable for hover, context-menu edit/delete, and Live Preview hiding; note text keeps its line breaks and symbols intact.
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - COMMENT_REGEX now spans lines via `[\s\S]*?` and uses `posToOffset/offsetToPos` to locate ranges across the whole doc.
  - Added `escapeDataNote`/`decodeDataNote` to fully escape `&`, `<`, `>`, quotes, backticks, and newlines in `data-note`, decoding before edit and re-encoding on save.
  - Live Preview decorations use decoded note text so hover/context-menu shows the correct content.

### Feature 2: Modal input & tooltip behavior polish
- **Summary**: Refine submit/newline handling in the annotation modal and auto-hide the tooltip after interactions.
- **Problem Solved**: Enter only inserted newlines and the tooltip could block text after clicks/keystrokes.
- **Feature Details**: Enter submits the note; Shift+Enter inserts a newline; any mouse click or key press hides the tooltip.
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Modal keydown logic updated: Enter submits, Shift+Enter keeps newline insertion.
  - Tooltip now listens to `mousedown`/`keydown` to call `hideTooltip`, alongside the existing mouseout behavior.

## v1.1.0 — Initial Public Release (2025-11-20)

### Feature 1: Insert annotations plus right-click edit/delete
- **Summary**: Command and context-menu flow to add, edit, or remove annotations quickly.
- **Problem Solved**: Needed a fast way to mark text in the editor and adjust or remove it later.
- **Feature Details**: Selected text is wrapped in `<span class="ob-comment" data-note="...">`; when the cursor is on an annotation, right-click shows edit and delete options.
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - `add-annotation-html` command plus `handleContextMenu` with `findAnnotationAtCursor` to locate annotations and `replaceRange` updates.
  - `AnnotationModal` gathers note text and writes it into `data-note` while preserving the original visible text.

### Feature 2: Hover display and Live Preview HTML hiding
- **Summary**: Show annotation notes on hover while hiding verbose HTML in edit mode.
- **Problem Solved**: Raw HTML tags cluttered the writing/reading experience.
- **Feature Details**: Hovering shows a tooltip in reading and preview; edit mode hides `<span>` tags and only highlights annotated text.
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Global `mouseover`/`mouseout` to show/hide tooltip.
  - CodeMirror `ViewPlugin` uses `Decoration.replace/mark` to hide tags and mark content, skipping annotations containing the active cursor.
